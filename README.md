# Spam Mail Detection Model
## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting spam emails using the spambase.csv dataset. Various classification algorithms such as XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Network, and Logistic Regression were explored and evaluated for their effectiveness in spam detection.

## Files Included

spambase.csv: Dataset containing features and labels for spam classification.
spam.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and tuning.
Knime-Spam: Knime workflow file for alternative analysis or comparison purposes.
## Features and Preprocessing
The spambase.csv dataset includes features like word frequencies and punctuation usage, which were preprocessed in spam.ipynb. Steps included:

Data cleaning and handling missing values.
Feature scaling or normalization if applicable.
Exploratory data analysis and visualization to understand data distribution.
## Models Tested
The following machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:

XGBoost: Gradient boosting algorithm known for its performance.
Random Forest: Ensemble method combining multiple decision trees.
SVM: Support Vector Machines for effective classification.
Neural Network: Deep learning model for complex pattern recognition.
Logistic Regression: Baseline model for binary classification.
## Model Evaluation
Evaluation metrics used:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
ROC-AUC
## Model Tuning
XGBoost was selected for tuning based on initial performance metrics. Hyperparameter tuning techniques such as grid search or random search were applied to optimize model performance.
